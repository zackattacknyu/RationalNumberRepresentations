The project RationalNumberRepresentations is meant to display any rational number in any base in either fraction form or repeating decimal form. 

The user will input a rational number as a fraction or a repeating decimal and the input can be in any base and the output will be the same rational number in a base of the user's choosing.

It uses Java BigIntegers to represent the numbers, so instead of the integer size limit, the size limit is 2 to the power 2 billion. 

The plan is to write a Java Applet and imbed it in a web page and then write an adroid applet for this.
